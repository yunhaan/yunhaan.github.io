description : "I'm currently pursuing a degree in industrial design at the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD) and am set to graduate in March 2025. In my view, gaining practical experience is crucial for a designer with specific goals. To put my design abilities into practice and address real-world issues, I have proactively engaged in hands-on projects throughout my academic journey. Being a part of these experiences has enabled me to enhance my skills and ready myself for a future profession where I can craft meaningful solutions to enhance the lives of others."
